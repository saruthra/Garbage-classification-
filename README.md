Project Description
In this project, we aim to develop a sophisticated garbage classification system leveraging the EfficientNetV2B2 architecture. Our primary dataset serves as a foundation for building models that can eventually automate waste segregation, a critical step in optimizing recycling and waste management, ultimately aiding in environmental conservation.

Goal: To develop an accurate and efficient garbage classification model using EfficientNetV2B2 and transfer learning for automated waste sorting.

Key Challenge: A notable challenge encountered is the inherent class imbalance within the dataset.


Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model developed for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a different but related task. It also allows us to build accurate models in a time-saving way by starting from patterns learned when solving a different problem. This approach is beneficial when there is limited data for the new task, as the pre-trained model already has learned features that can be adapted. Transfer learning can significantly improve models' performance and efficiency in domains like computer vision and natural language processing.
